<h2>GAJ Calculators: Appliance Installment Plan Calculator</h2>
<h4>Making your buying easier!</h4>
<p>
 Appliances are usually paid on installment basis. The installment payment method allows you to own an item as soon as you need it with much less worry about the cost. The amount you have to pay is divided into a period of time that varies from a few months to a couple of years.
</p>
<p><em>
  An installment plan is a way of buying products gradually. You make regular payments to the seller until, after some time, you have paid the full price.
